[Check the main repo](https://github.com/JorgeEncinas/CS50-Web-Compiled)

<p align="justify">This is a Social Media website, very much like Twitter. I had to work on both Backend and Frontend on this one. 
This is the one that required the most work for sure. You can post, like/unlike posts, follow people, edit posts.</p>
